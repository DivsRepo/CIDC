The PDF Filler project automated the process of analyzing and completing non-fillable PDF forms using OCR-style detection, text extraction, and computer-vision techniques. It identified field regions, matched them to semantic labels, and generated a flattened, visually accurate filled PDF. During development, we discovered the source form was a static, non-interactive PDF, requiring a custom stamping approach instead of standard AcroForm filling. The project delivered a functional pipeline for parsing, mapping, and auto-filling complex PDF layouts.
